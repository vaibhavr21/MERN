import {sum} from "./math.js"

we cant selectively load only the pieces we need with require but with import, we can selectively load only the pieces we need, which can save memory.

Loading is synchronous for 'require' but can be asynchronous for "import"


create math.js 
in math.js 

export const sum = (a,b) => a+b;
export const mul = (a,b) => a*b;
export const g = 9.8;
export const pie = 3.14;


create script.js

import {sum , pie} from "./math.js"
console.log(sum(2,3)); 
console.log(pie);

to run this open vscode and type
node script.js 

//output
5
3.14



let understand with a example 
create a folder named random-words 
and in that npm init
type:"module"
npm install random-words
create index.js
in index.js

import { generate } from "random-words";

console.log(generate())

to run this open vscode terminal and go to random-words folder and write node index.js 

//output
together
